# Overview

In this project, I created a basic calculator using the C++ programming language to further enhance my understanding of software development and algorithm design. The goal of this project was to implement a simple command-line-based calculator that handles basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project demonstrates my ability to use C++ syntax, manage user input, and apply core programming concepts such as functions, loops, and conditionals to build functional software.

This software showcases a calculator that allows users to input two numbers and select an operation to perform. The result is displayed back to the user through the command line. The focus of this project was on practicing coding logic and structure, handling user input, and refining my understanding of C++ language features.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used the following development tools:
- **Visual Studio Code**: This lightweight code editor was used for writing and editing the C++ code.
- **g++ Compiler**: The GNU C++ compiler was used to compile and build the program.
- **Command Line (Powershell)**: The program was executed through the command line interface to test its functionality.

The programming language used for this project is **C++**, and no additional libraries were used beyond the C++ Standard Library.

- [Cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com) – A helpful resource for understanding C++ syntax and standard library functions.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) – Useful for troubleshooting and seeking answers to specific C++ programming questions.

# Future Work

- **Improve Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for invalid user input, such as non-numeric entries or division by zero.
- **Expand Functionality**: Add support for more advanced mathematical operations, such as exponents and square roots.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Explore creating a graphical interface using libraries like Qt or SFML to make the calculator more user-friendly.
- **Optimization**: Review and optimize the code for efficiency and scalability.
